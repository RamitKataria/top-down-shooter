# My Personal Project

## Introduction

- **What will the application do?**  
The application is a 2D game with walls that will bounce 
some of the game objects and different types of enemies.

- **Who will use it?**  
Anyone who wants to play an offline game would play it.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**
I wanted to make something that would be used by people in 
real life and not just something that I make for this 
course. Also, I wanted it to not have any errors with the 
AutoTest bot we use for this course. Therefore, I decided 
to make an offline program. A game like is the most 
interesting project to me because it is the best offline
program to make with the skills I currently have in my 
opinion.
